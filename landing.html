                    <p class="textMy text-align-center">Hello, my name is Trelin Stevens and I'm from Jackson, Mississippi born and raise I attend mississippi coding academy and I try to improve my self by learing and growing to be able to better understand code and develop it while attending. I grew up in the north side of Jackson, and I was able to attend a couple of elemantary schools the one I most remember would be Boyd elemantary. There I would be a big trouble maker but tend to be  on my best behavior to not get in trouble. The school was never bad but others did have a bad influence on me so for the last year my mother didn't like the bad influence so I attended a school one of Mississippis first republic charter school. The school was able to help teach young black students that you can be anything if you put your mind to it and the school was telling the truth it took me time and time for me to understand that and how it was challenge to find what I wanted to do because I really didn't take more ideas for me to be where I wanted to be to understand me and my future.</p>

                    <p class="textMy">After graduting from a good 5 years of my middle school it was decent and enjoyful but I didn't really get into any clubs of sports like that maybe beacuse I couldn't careless. But lookin back at it now wish I did. Soon as I went to highschool my mother set me up for the band which at first I wasn't so thrilled about and still wasn't though out my 4 years of highschool. The band did also change my view on the things I knew I did and did not want to do. I also learn things like some instruments and music and the background history of some music that people play till this day. I know that in life you have to have patience but dont wast your life away thats what my people were trying to show me and after a little college I figured out what I was looking foward to for a good minute of my life. And it was a good and wise decision to focus and learn at Mississippi coding academy.</p>
