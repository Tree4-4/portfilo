                    <p class="textMy text-align-center">Hello, my name is Trelin stevens and I'm from Jackson, Mississippi born and raise I attend mississippi coding academy and I try to improve my self by learing and growing to be able to better understand code. I grew up in the north side of Jackson, mississippi and I was able to attend a couple of elemantary schools the one I most remember would be Boyd elemantary. There I would be a very trouble maker but tend to be a on my best behaivor to not get in trouble the school was never bad but others did have a bad influence on me. So for the last year my mom was like no to bad influence so I attended a school one of Mississippis first republic charter school were I was able met my best friends. The school was able to help teach young black studnet that you can be anything if you put your mind to it and the school was telling the truth it took me time and time for me to understand that and how it was challenge to find what I wanted because I really didn't take more ides for me to be where I wanted to be to understand me and my future.</p>

                    <p class="textMy">After graduting from a good 5 years of my middle school it was decent and enjoyful but I didn't really get into any clubs of sports like that maybe beacuse I couldn't careless but lookin back at it now wish I did. But soon as I went to highschool my mother set me up for the band which at first I wasn't so thrilled about and still wasn't thought the 4 years of highschool. The band did also change my perpesction on the things I knew I did and did not want to do but I also learn things like some instruments and music and the background of some music that people play till this day. I know that in life you have to have patience but dont wast you life away thats what my people were tryign to show me and after alittle college I figured out what I was looking foward to for a good minute of my life.</p>
